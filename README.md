# Project Euler Problems Solved Using Kotlin

## Introduction

This repository hosts solutions to my take on answering the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problem sets in Kotlin!

## Instructions

The project is more or less laid out as follows:

```
.
|____src
| |____test
| | |____resources
| | |____java
| | |____kotlin
| |____main
| | |____resources
| | |____java
| | |____kotlin
| | | |____io
| | | | |____github
| | | | | |____aishrath
| | | | | | |____euler
| | | | | | | |____Problem_1.kt
| | | | | | | |____Problem_2.kt

```
Refer to the `package io.github.aishrath.euler` package to see a `Problem_n.kt` file which you 
can run (by invoking the respective file's `main` method) to see an output which corresponds 
to the same problem number on the Project Euler website.
